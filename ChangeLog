  - check with test data if output is now correct
* wevt
  - improve (template) codepage handling
  - improve template definition XML template value handling
* format string
  - merge with libevt
  - improve UserData support
  - implement evtx template definition
  - strip \r
  - check remove successive \n
  - conversion specifier "%%"
  - print unused conversion specifiers
  - print unsupported conversion specifiers ?
* message handle:
  - create: message string object
  - get %WinDir% from registry
* resource file
  - cache message strings
  - cache template providers
  - cache template events
  - cache template definitions

* update msvscpp files

* XML output change
  - Keywords add 0x no leading 0's
    <Keywords>8080000000000000</Keywords>
    <Keywords>0x8080000000000000</Keywords>

strings:
- support non-contiguous data elements ?

libfwevt optimization:
- reference value while parsing?
- count number of data elements (strings) while parsing
- reference binary (data) while parsing

* API
  - get op code (0 => Info)
  - task category (none if not set)
  - keywords

* recovery:
  - pass what type of chunk is being read
  - pass flag to binary xml parsing to ignore parsing errors ?
    or make this the default behavior
  - move read xml out of init record function ?
* fix message filename retrieval, registry being read wrong ?
* implement libevtx_xml_tag_get_attribute_by_utf8_path (and utf16 equivalent) ?
* implement libevtx_xml_tag_get_element_by_utf8_path (and utf16 equivalent) ?
* store name hash in value identifier
* deal with corruption scenario
* deal with trailing empty data ?
* remove libevtx_libfguid.h once libfvalue wraps the format flags
* evtxeport:
  - rewrite using evtexport
  - export format: xml
  - non-xml export format use evtexport like approach (add functions to get
    specific event data)
* add recovery scan
* add debug function for binary XML token types
* codepage support
* flag internally if the file is corrupted (CRC mismatch)

Debug:
* libfwevt: character reference print trailing data

Recovery:
* scan for records in chunk free space
